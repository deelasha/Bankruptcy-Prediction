# Bankruptcy-Prediction
A project of bankruptcy prediction using Machine learning
Dataset provided by Taiwan Stock Exchange

Summary:
Bankruptcy prediction is the task of predicting bankruptcy. This project is about to find how accurate the model is bulit and compare the accuracy, ROC and AUC of two 
algorithm.
The aim of predicting financial distress is to develop a predictive model that combines various econometric
parameters which allow foreseeing the financial condition of a firm. In this project we document our observations 
as we explore, build, and compare, some of the widely used classification models:

1) Logistic Regression
2) Support Vector Machine(SVM)

The dataset that I will be using for this task is collected from Kaggle and it is provided by the Taiwan Economic Journal.
